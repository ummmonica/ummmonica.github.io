                    Did you know that the first person to be a computer programmer is a woman by the name of Ada Lovelace? Lovelace was born December 10, 1815 in London. She was born to two English poets who separated when she was still an adolescent. From a young age, her grandparents strongly encouraged Lovelace to remain engaged in her studies. One day, she attended mathmematician and philospher, Charles Babbage's party. Impressed with Lovelace's intellect, Babbage invited her over the next day to see his new prototype of a mechanical calculator.

                <p> 
                    Lovelace eventually got married and bore three children. However, her fascination with mathematics never cease. She continued to work with Babbage on his projects, interpreting his work for publishing. Lovelace was also one of the first people to predict the possibility of the <abbr title ="Artificial Intelligence"> A.I.</abbr> as we understand it today. She understood that AI could accomplish many tasks, but also argued that they would only be as capable as what humans could do, as they are the engineers of the program.

                <p>
                    Unfortunately, Lovelace contributions were cut short at the young age of 36, due to cancer. Lovelace was an intelligent woman with a passion to learn and yearn for a deeper understanding. Her ability to develop an abstract understanding of what computers could do is what made her stand out from her contemporaries and allowed her to write the first computer program. Even with her passing, to this date, her notes are considered to be one of the most comprehensive account of computers.
